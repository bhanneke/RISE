## WRDS MCP (recommended for AI agents)

John Barrios's **wrds-mcp** server exposes WRDS to Cursor, Claude, and other MCP clients.

**Before querying WRDS, the user must:**

1. Install the MCP from [`mcp/wrds-mcp/`](../../../mcp/wrds-mcp/) — see **[install/wrds-mcp.md](../../../install/wrds-mcp.md)**
2. Set **their own** credentials: `WRDS_USERNAME` and `WRDS_PASSWORD` (from their WRDS account)
3. Start the tunnel: `bash mcp/wrds-mcp/tunnel/tunnel_up.sh` and approve **Duo MFA** once per session
4. Register the MCP with `WRDS_TUNNEL_PORT=49600` in Cursor or Claude config

**When to use WRDS instead / with EDGAR:** Compustat fundamentals panels, CRSP returns, CCM links, ExecuComp, ISS, TRACE/TAQ — use this skill + wrds-mcp. For live filing text, XBRL facts, and public Forms 3/4/5 without WRDS panel infrastructure, use the [`sec-edgar`](../../research-tools/sec-edgar/) skill + [SEC EDGAR MCP](../../../install/sec-edgar-mcp.md).

When MCP tools are available (`wrds_run_sql`, `wrds_get_compustat`, etc.), **prefer MCP over raw Python connections**. Still apply all filter rules in this skill.

If the user has not configured MCP credentials, **stop and walk them through** [install/wrds-mcp.md](../../../install/wrds-mcp.md) — do not guess usernames or passwords.

# WRDS Data Access

WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) provides academic research data via PostgreSQL at `wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737`.

## Query Enforcement

### IRON LAW: NO QUERY WITHOUT FILTER VALIDATION FIRST

Before executing ANY WRDS query, you MUST:
1. **IDENTIFY** what filters are required for this dataset
2. **VALIDATE** the query includes those filters
3. **VERIFY** parameterized queries (never string formatting)
4. **EXECUTE** the query
5. **INSPECT** a sample of results before claiming success

This is not negotiable. Claiming query success without sample inspection is LYING to the user about data quality.

### Rationalization Table - STOP If You Think:

| Excuse | Reality | Do Instead |
|--------|---------|------------|
| "I'll add filters later" | You'll forget and pull bad data | Add filters NOW, before execution |
| "User didn't specify filters" | Standard filters are ALWAYS required | Apply Critical Filters section defaults |
| "Just a quick test query" | Test queries with bad filters teach bad patterns | Use production filters even for tests |
| "I'll let the user filter in pandas" | Pulling millions of unnecessary rows wastes time/memory | Filter at database level FIRST |
| "The query worked, so it's correct" | Query success ≠ data quality | INSPECT sample for invalid records |
| "I can use f-strings for simple queries" | SQL injection risk + wrong type handling | ALWAYS use parameterized queries |

### Red Flags - STOP Immediately If You Think:

- "Let me run this query quickly to see what's there" → NO. Check Critical Filters section first.
- "I'll just pull everything and filter later" → NO. Database-level filtering is mandatory.
- "The table name is obvious from the request" → NO. Check Quick Reference section for exact names.
- "I can inspect the data after the user sees it" → NO. Sample inspection BEFORE claiming success.

### Query Validation Checklist

Before EVERY query execution:

**For Compustat queries (comp.funda, comp.fundq):**
- [ ] Includes `indfmt = 'INDL'`
- [ ] Includes `datafmt = 'STD'`
- [ ] Includes `popsrc = 'D'`
- [ ] Includes `consol = 'C'`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries for variables
- [ ] Date range is explicitly specified

**For CRSP v2 queries (crsp.dsf_v2, crsp.msf_v2):**
- [ ] Post-query filter: `sharetype == 'NS'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `securitytype == 'EQTY'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `securitysubtype == 'COM'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `usincflg == 'Y'`
- [ ] Post-query filter: `issuertype.isin(['ACOR', 'CORP'])`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries

**For Form 4 queries (tr_insiders.table1):**
- [ ] Transaction type filter specified (acqdisp)
- [ ] Transaction codes specified (trancode)
- [ ] Date range is explicitly specified
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries

**For TAQ queries (taqm_YYYY.ctm_* / cqm_* / complete_nbbo_*):**
- [ ] Using `taqm_YYYY` (daily partitioned) for post-2003 work, not legacy `taq`
- [ ] Trade filter: `tr_corr = '00'` (string, not integer)
- [ ] Trade conditions: drop `tr_scond` containing `Z`, `O`, `T`, `U`, `G`, `B` (non-regular)
- [ ] Regular trading hours: `time_m BETWEEN '09:30:00' AND '16:00:00'`
- [ ] Price > 0 and size > 0 sanity checks
- [ ] For NBBO: use `complete_nbbo_*` (not `nbbom_*` — incomplete by design)
- [ ] If joining to CRSP: use `wrdsapps_link_crsp_taqm` with `sdate`/`edate` bounds
- [ ] Consider `wrds_iid_YYYY` for pre-computed daily liquidity measures
- [ ] Never `SELECT *` — specify columns (ctm has 20, cqm/nbbom are huge)
- [ ] Sort explicitly by `(time_m, time_m_nano, tr_seqnum)` — insertion order not guaranteed

**For TRACE queries (trace_enhanced.trace_enhanced):**
- [ ] Using `trace_enhanced` (uncapped) not `trace_standard` (capped) for research
- [ ] Dick-Nielsen cleaning applied: drop `trc_st IN ('X','C','W','Y')` + matched originals
- [ ] Pre-/post-2012-02-06 logic branch selected correctly
- [ ] Agency double-count filter: `NOT (cmsn_trd='Y' AND cntra_mp_id='D')`
- [ ] Commissioned trades handled (`cmsn_trd='N'` for price/yield work)
- [ ] Special trades excluded: `spcl_trd_fl != 'Y'` (for price/liquidity analysis)
- [ ] FISD merge for bond characteristics (coupon, maturity, rating, issuer)
- [ ] Date range is explicitly specified on `trd_exctn_dt`
- [ ] Uses parameterized queries

**For ALL queries:**
- [ ] Sample inspection with `.head()` or `.sample()` BEFORE claiming success
- [ ] Row count verification (is result size reasonable?)
- [ ] NULL value check on critical columns
- [ ] Date range validation (does min/max match expectations?)

## Connection

Initialize PostgreSQL connection to WRDS:

```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host='wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu',
    port=9737,
    database='wrds',
    sslmode='require'
    # Credentials from ~/.pgpass
)
```

Configure authentication via `~/.pgpass` with `chmod 600`:
```
wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737:wrds:USERNAME:PASSWORD
```

Connect via SSH tunnel:
```bash
ssh wrds
```

This uses `~/.ssh/wrds_rsa` for authentication.

## Critical Filters

### Compustat Standard Filters
Always include for clean fundamental data:
```sql
WHERE indfmt = 'INDL'
  AND datafmt = 'STD'
  AND popsrc = 'D'
  AND consol = 'C'
```

### CRSP v2 Common Stock Filter
Equivalent to legacy `shrcd IN (10, 11)`:
```python
df = df.loc[
    (df.sharetype == 'NS') &
    (df.securitytype == 'EQTY') &
    (df.securitysubtype == 'COM') &
    (df.usincflg == 'Y') &
    (df.issuertype.isin(['ACOR', 'CORP']))
]
```

### Form 4 Transaction Types
```sql
WHERE acqdisp = 'D'  -- Dispositions
  AND trancode IN ('S', 'D', 'G', 'F')  -- Sales, Dispositions, Gifts, Tax
```

### TAQ Standard Cleaning (Holden-Jacobsen 2014)
Minimum filter for academic intraday work:
```sql
-- Trades (ctm_YYYYMMDD)
WHERE tr_corr = '00'                               -- uncorrected
  AND price > 0 AND size > 0
  AND time_m BETWEEN '09:30:00'::time AND '16:00:00'::time
  AND (tr_scond IS NULL OR tr_scond = ''
       OR tr_scond !~ '[BGJKLOTUWZ4567]')          -- regular-way only

-- Quotes (cqm_YYYYMMDD)
WHERE bid > 0 AND ask > 0 AND ask > bid
  AND bidsiz > 0 AND asksiz > 0
  AND qu_cond IN ('A','B','H','O','R','W')
  AND time_m BETWEEN '09:30:00'::time AND '16:00:00'::time
```
**Always prefer `complete_nbbo_*` over `nbbom_*`** — the raw NBBO feed is
incomplete when one exchange holds both sides of the top of book. If
re-deriving, UNION `nbbom` with `cqm` records where
`natbbo_ind='1' OR nasdbbo_ind='4'`. See `references/taq.md`.

### TRACE Enhanced Cleaning (Dick-Nielsen 2014)
Apply BEFORE any price/volume analysis:
```sql
-- Post-2012-02-06: drop cancels, corrections, reversals + their matched originals.
-- Match originals on (cusip_id, entrd_vol_qt, rptd_pr, trd_exctn_dt,
-- trd_exctn_tm, rpt_side_cd, cntra_mp_id, msg_seq_nb).
WHERE trc_st = 'T'                              -- keep only clean originals
  AND NOT (cmsn_trd = 'Y' AND cntra_mp_id = 'D') -- drop agency double count
  AND spcl_trd_fl != 'Y'                         -- drop special-condition trades
  AND wis_fl != 'Y'                              -- drop when-issued
  -- For price/yield work, also:
  AND cmsn_trd = 'N'
```
Pre-2012-02-06 data uses `asof_cd = 'R'` for reversals instead of `trc_st = 'Y'`;
use the pre-2012 branch. See `references/trace.md`.

## Parameterized Queries

Always use parameterized queries (never string formatting):

Use scalar parameter binding for single values:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT gvkey, conm FROM comp.company WHERE gvkey = %s
""", (gvkey,))
```

Use ANY() for list parameters:
```python
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT * FROM comp.funda WHERE gvkey = ANY(%s)
""", (gvkey_list,))
```

## Date Awareness

When querying historical data, leverage current date context for dynamic range calculations.

Current date is automatically available via `datetime.now()`. Apply this to:
- Data range validation (e.g., "get data for last 5 years")
- Fiscal year calculations
- Event study windows

Implement dynamic date ranges in queries:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Query last 5 years of data
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=5*365)

query = """
SELECT * FROM comp.funda
WHERE datadate BETWEEN %s AND %s
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=(start_date, end_date))
```

Always incorporate current date awareness in date-dependent queries to ensure results remain fresh across time.
