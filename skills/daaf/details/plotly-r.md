# plotly-r Skill

Interactive R visualization with the plotly package (4.12.0). Covers plot_ly()
for direct trace-based charts (scatter, line, bar, histogram, box, heatmap, 3D
scatter, 3D surface); ggplotly() for converting ggplot2 objects to interactive
equivalents; layout() for axis, title, legend, and annotation customization;
subplot() for multi-panel composition; and htmlwidgets::saveWidget() for
self-contained HTML export. Use when execution language is R and interactive
hover/zoom/pan behavior is needed. Python equivalent: plotly (Plotly Express +
Graph Objects). For static publication-quality R figures, use ggplot2 instead.

## What is plotly for R?

plotly is an R interface to the Plotly.js JavaScript library:
- **Interactive**: Hover, zoom, pan, and select built-in
- **Two approaches**: plot_ly() (direct) and ggplotly() (convert from ggplot2)
- **Web-based**: Renders as HTML/JavaScript via htmlwidgets
- **Wide chart support**: scatter, line, bar, histogram, box, heatmap, 3D, maps
- **Piping**: Works with R's native pipe `|>` for chained layout/trace updates

|------|---------|--------------|

| `ggplotly.md` | Converting ggplot2 objects, tooltip customization | ggplot2 bridge |

### Reading Order

1. **Quick plot?** Start with `quickstart.md`
2. **Which chart?** Check `chart-types.md`
3. **Have ggplot2 code?** Read `ggplotly.md`
4. **Customize layout?** Read `layouts.md`
5. **Save/export?** Read `export.md`
6. **Multiple panels?** Read `subplots.md`
7. **Trouble?** Check `gotchas.md`

## Quick Decision Trees

### "What chart type do I need?"

```
What are you visualizing?
|-- Relationship (x vs y)
|   |-- Continuous x, continuous y -> plot_ly(type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
|   |-- Time series -> plot_ly(type = "scatter", mode = "lines")
|   +-- With error/uncertainty -> add error bars via error_y
|-- Distribution
|   |-- One variable -> plot_ly(type = "histogram")
|   |-- By group -> plot_ly(type = "box") or plot_ly(type = "violin")
|   +-- Heatmap/density -> plot_ly(type = "heatmap")
|-- Comparison
|   |-- Counts/values -> plot_ly(type = "bar")
|   +-- Grouped -> barmode = "group" in layout()
|-- 3D
|   |-- Scatter -> plot_ly(type = "scatter3d")
|   +-- Surface -> plot_ly(type = "surface")
+-- Already have ggplot2 code -> ggplotly(p)
```

### "How do I save this plot?"

```
Saving a plot?
|-- Interactive HTML (primary DAAF export) -> htmlwidgets::saveWidget()
|-- Static PNG (requires orca/kaleido) -> orca() or kaleido()
|-- Embed in Quarto -> just print the widget in a code chunk
+-- Temp file (smoke tests) -> saveWidget(p, tempfile(fileext = ".html"))
```

### "plot_ly() or ggplotly()?"

```
Which approach?
|-- Building from scratch -> plot_ly()
|-- Already have ggplot2 code -> ggplotly()
|-- Need fine-grained trace control -> plot_ly()
|-- Quick interactive version of static plot -> ggplotly()
|-- Complex multi-trace with mixed types -> plot_ly() + add_trace()
+-- Want ggplot2 facets interactive -> ggplotly() (preserves faceting)
```

## File-First Execution in Research Workflows

In DAAF research pipelines, all visualizations are generated through **script
files** in `scripts/stage8_analysis/`, not interactively. This ensures auditability
and reproducibility.

**The pattern:**
1. Write plot code to `scripts/stage8_analysis/{step}_{plot-name}.R`
2. Execute via `bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {script_path}`
3. Output gets appended to the script as comments
4. Use `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()` to save interactive HTML to the project output directory

See `agent_reference/SCRIPT_EXECUTION_REFERENCE.md` for the mandatory file-first
execution protocol.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Setup

```r
library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)  # saveWidget() for HTML export
```

### Basic plot_ly() Pattern

```r
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~col_x, y = ~col_y, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
p
```

Note the **formula interface**: columns are referenced with `~col_name` (tilde
prefix), not bare names or strings.

### ggplotly() Bridge

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

g <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()

p <- ggplotly(g)
p
```

### Common plot_ly() Trace Types

| Type | Mode | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| `"scatter"` | `"markers"` | Scatter plot |
| `"scatter"` | `"lines"` | Line chart |
| `"scatter"` | `"lines+markers"` | Line with points |
| `"bar"` | — | Bar chart |
| `"histogram"` | — | Histogram |
| `"box"` | — | Box plot |
| `"heatmap"` | — | Heatmap |
| `"scatter3d"` | `"markers"` | 3D scatter |
| `"surface"` | — | 3D surface |

### Layout Customization

```r
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~x, y = ~y, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") |>
  layout(
    title = "My Plot",
    xaxis = list(title = "X Label"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Y Label")
  )
```

### Saving Plots

```r
library(htmlwidgets)

# HTML export (uses CDN for plotly.js -- default for DAAF)
saveWidget(p, "plot.html", selfcontained = FALSE)

# Self-contained HTML (embeds plotly.js, ~3MB -- requires pandoc)
# saveWidget(p, "plot.html", selfcontained = TRUE)  # NOT available in DAAF (no pandoc)
```

> **DAAF note:** `selfcontained = TRUE` requires pandoc, which is not installed
> in the DAAF container. Use `selfcontained = FALSE` (loads plotly.js from CDN).
> Static image export via `orca()` or `kaleido()` is also not available. Use
> **ggplot2** with `ggsave()` for static PNG/SVG figures.

### Piping with |>

plotly R functions return the plot object, enabling piping:

```r
p <- plot_ly(df, x = ~x, y = ~y, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") |>
  add_trace(y = ~y2, name = "Series 2", mode = "lines") |>
  layout(title = "Two Series", xaxis = list(title = "X")) |>
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```
