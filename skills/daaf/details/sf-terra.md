# sf-terra Skill

R geospatial analysis with sf (Simple Features for R), terra (modern raster
operations), spdep/spatialreg (spatial statistics and spatial econometrics),
leaflet (interactive web maps), and classInt (classification breaks for
choropleth maps). Covers sf objects, CRS management, spatial joins, geometric
operations, raster creation and manipulation, choropleth maps via
ggplot2 + geom_sf(), interactive maps via leaflet, and spatial autocorrelation
and regression. Use when the execution language is R and the task involves
spatial data, map-making, or spatial statistics. Python equivalent: the
geopandas skill.

## What is sf?

sf (Simple Features) is the modern R package for vector geospatial data:

- **sf objects**: An sf object is a data.frame (or tibble) with a special `geometry` list-column containing sfc geometries -- tabular data meets spatial operations
- **Tidyverse integration**: sf objects work with dplyr verbs (`filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`), and the geometry column is preserved automatically
- **ggplot2 integration**: `geom_sf()` plots sf objects with automatic CRS-aware axis labels
- **GDAL/GEOS/PROJ backend**: Full access to industry-standard spatial libraries
- **Successor to sp/rgdal/rgeos**: Those packages are retired; sf is the standard

## What is terra?

terra is the modern R package for raster data (replaces the retired `raster` package):

- **SpatRaster objects**: Multi-band, multi-layer raster data with CRS and extent metadata
- **Raster arithmetic**: Element-wise operations, aggregation, focal operations
- **Raster-vector interaction**: `extract()`, `crop()`, `mask()` using sf geometries
- **Memory-efficient**: Processes large rasters on disk without loading everything into memory

## Version Notes

Versions installed in the DAAF container (R 4.5.3):

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| sf | 1.1-0 | Vector spatial data (Simple Features) |
| terra | 1.9-11 | Raster spatial data |
| stars | 0.7.2 | Spatiotemporal arrays (raster time series) |
| spdep | 1.4.2 | Spatial weights and spatial autocorrelation |
| spatialreg | 1.4.3 | Spatial regression models (SAR, SEM, SDM) |
| leaflet | 2.2.3 | Interactive web maps |
| classInt | 0.4.11 | Classification intervals for choropleth breaks |

**sf 1.x changes to be aware of:**
- s2 geometry engine enabled by default for geographic CRS (spherical geometry) -- this changes area/distance/intersection behavior from earlier versions
- Use `sf_use_s2(FALSE)` to temporarily revert to planar GEOS operations when s2 produces unexpected results (see `gotchas.md`)
- `st_make_valid()` is now built into sf (no longer needs lwgeom)

## Also Available in This Environment

Four additional spatial packages are installed (versions verified) that map to
capabilities the `geopandas` skill documents on the Python side:

| Package | Version | Purpose | geopandas-skill equivalent |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| maptiles | 0.11.0 | Basemap tiles for static maps (`get_tiles()`) | contextily |
| exactextractr | 0.10.1 | Fast, exact zonal statistics of rasters over polygons (`exact_extract()`) | rasterstats zonal stats |
| osmdata | 0.3.0 | Download OpenStreetMap features via the Overpass API | osmnx / OSM download |
| tidygeocoder | 1.0.6 | Geocoding addresses to coordinates (`geocode()`) | geopy geocoding |

**Honest asymmetry:** point-pattern analysis (Ripley's K/G/F functions, spatial
point process models) requires `spatstat`, which is **not installed** — for
point-pattern methods, Python (PySAL `pointpats` via the `geopandas` skill) is
the routed path. Areal interpolation (`tobler`-style) also has no installed R
equivalent.

## How to Use This Skill

| `quickstart.md` | sf objects, st_read/st_write, basic plotting, CRS inspection | Starting with sf or quick reminder |
| `crs.md` | st_transform(), EPSG codes, CRS management, projection pitfalls | CRS errors or projection decisions |
| `spatial-ops.md` | st_join(), st_buffer(), st_intersection(), st_union(), geometric operations | Combining or transforming spatial data |
| `raster.md` | terra::rast(), raster arithmetic, extract(), crop/mask, raster-vector interaction | Working with raster data |

### Reading Order

1. **New to sf?** Start with `quickstart.md` then `spatial-ops.md`
2. **Making maps?** Read `mapping.md` (relies on `crs.md` for projection choices)
3. **Interactive maps?** Read `interactive.md`
4. **Raster data?** Read `raster.md`
5. **Spatial statistics?** Read `spatial-stats.md` (for methodology context, also load `data-scientist` skill's `geospatial-analysis.md`)
6. **Having issues?** Check `gotchas.md` first

## File-First Execution in Research Workflows

In DAAF research pipelines, R spatial operations follow the **file-first execution
protocol** -- code is written to `.R` script files and executed via the
`run_with_capture.sh` wrapper, never run interactively.

**The pattern:**
1. Write spatial analysis code to `scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{task-name}.R`
2. Execute via Bash: `bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/{script_name}.R`
3. `run_with_capture.sh` detects the `.R` extension and uses `Rscript` automatically
4. stdout/stderr are appended to the script file as comments
5. If a script fails, create a versioned copy (`_a.R`, `_b.R`, etc.) for fixes

Read `agent_reference/SCRIPT_EXECUTION_REFERENCE.md` for the complete protocol.

**R spatial script structure follows DAAF conventions:**

```r
# --- Config ---
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

PROJECT_DIR <- "/daaf/research/YYYY-MM-DD_Project"
TARGET_CRS <- 5070  # NAD83 Conus Albers

# --- Load ---
# INTENT: Load school point data and county boundaries
schools <- st_read(file.path(PROJECT_DIR, "data", "schools.gpkg")) |>
  st_transform(TARGET_CRS)
counties <- st_read(file.path(PROJECT_DIR, "data", "counties.gpkg")) |>
  st_transform(TARGET_CRS)
cat("Schools:", nrow(schools), "rows\n")
cat("Counties:", nrow(counties), "rows\n")

# --- Transform ---
# INTENT: Assign each school to its county via spatial join
# ASSUMES: All schools fall within a county boundary
joined <- st_join(schools, counties["county_name"], join = st_within)

# --- Validate ---
stopifnot(nrow(joined) == nrow(schools))
stopifnot(sum(is.na(joined$county_name)) == 0)
cat("Join complete:", nrow(joined), "schools matched\n")

# --- Save ---
st_write(joined, file.path(PROJECT_DIR, "data", "schools_with_county.gpkg"),
         delete_dsn = TRUE)
cat("Saved: schools_with_county.gpkg\n")
```
