# Data Scientist Skill

Rigorous data science methodology and mindset for quantitative research in Python or R. Covers EDA, data validation, transformation verification, documentation standards, visualization design, descriptive analysis, statistical modeling, causal inference method selection (IV, DiD, RD, synthetic control), unsupervised analysis (clustering, PCA, UMAP), supervised ML methodology (prediction vs. inference, cross-validation, model interpretation, fairness), geospatial analysis, and network analysis (centrality, community detection, bipartite graphs). Provides methodology decisions and analytical approach guidance. Load the routed, language-appropriate tool-specific skill (Python: polars, statsmodels, plotnine, pyfixest, scikit-learn, geopandas, igraph; R: tidyverse, r-stats, ggplot2, fixest, tidymodels, sf-terra, igraph-r; etc.) before giving tool-specific advice or writing code — library skills encode environment-specific constraints and curated caveats that general knowledge lacks or gets wrong. Use for any data analysis, exploration, transformation, or modeling task — especially when choosing methods, checking assumptions, or structuring an analysis.

Establishes a rigorous, methodical approach to data science work. This skill is about *how* to think and work, not specific tools. The moment a specific tool enters the conversation — in advice and brainstorming as much as in code — load its specialized skill (Python: polars, plotnine, plotly, marimo; R: tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly-r, quarto; etc.): those skills know this environment's tooling in ways general knowledge does not.

## Core Principles - NON-NEGOTIABLE

These five principles must guide ALL data science work. They are not optional.

### Principle 1: Data Robustness First

**ALWAYS check data before operating on it.**

Before ANY analysis or transformation:
- Check shape, types, and memory usage
- Examine value distributions and ranges
- Identify and characterize missing values (count, percentage, pattern)
- Understand what uniquely identifies each row (granularity)
- Look for outliers and anomalies

Be VERBOSE about what you're checking and what you find. Never assume data is clean.

**Python:**
```python
# ALWAYS start with this pattern
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Columns: {df.columns.to_list()}")
print(f"Types:\n{df.dtypes}")
print(f"Null counts:\n{df.null_count()}")
print(f"Sample:\n{df.sample(5)}")
```

**R:**
```r
# ALWAYS start with this pattern
cat("Shape:", nrow(df), "x", ncol(df), "\n")
cat("Columns:", paste(names(df), collapse = ", "), "\n")
str(df)
cat("Null counts:\n")
print(colSums(is.na(df)))
cat("Sample:\n")
print(df[sample(nrow(df), 5), ])
```

This principle applies only when you are conducting actual data work. Do NOT conduct net new analyses or data inspections when tasked with compiling past work (e.g., analytic notebook creation), or synthesizing prior analyses into a report (e.g., final report writing).

### Principle 2: Documentation First

**ALWAYS understand or create data documentation.**

Before analysis:
- Seek data dictionaries, schemas, or documentation
- Understand where data comes from (provenance)
- Learn collection methods and their implications
- Identify known quality issues or caveats
- Clarify what each column means in business context

If documentation doesn't exist, CREATE IT as you learn about the data.

### Principle 3: Verify Every Operation

**NEVER assume a transformation worked correctly.**

For EVERY data operation:
- Check row counts before and after
- Examine random samples of affected rows
- Validate that expected changes occurred
- Confirm no unintended side effects
- Document what you checked and what you found

**Python:**
```python
# Before transformation
print(f"Before: {len(df)} rows, columns: {df.columns.to_list()}")
sample_before = df.filter(pl.col("id").is_in([1, 42, 100]))

# After transformation
print(f"After: {len(result)} rows, columns: {result.columns.to_list()}")
sample_after = result.filter(pl.col("id").is_in([1, 42, 100]))
print(f"Sample comparison:\nBefore:\n{sample_before}\nAfter:\n{sample_after}")
```

**R:**
```r
# Before transformation
cat("Before:", nrow(df), "rows, columns:", paste(names(df), collapse = ", "), "\n")
sample_before <- df |> dplyr::filter(id %in% c(1, 42, 100))

# After transformation
cat("After:", nrow(result), "rows, columns:", paste(names(result), collapse = ", "), "\n")
sample_after <- result |> dplyr::filter(id %in% c(1, 42, 100))
cat("Sample comparison:\nBefore:\n")
print(sample_before)
cat("After:\n")
print(sample_after)
```

### Principle 4: Thorough Code Documentation (ENFORCED)

**Write extensive comments explaining your reasoning. This is MANDATORY, not optional.**

In research workflows, follow the **Inline Audit Trail (IAT)** standard (see `agent_reference/INLINE_AUDIT_TRAIL.md`). The IAT standard is enforced during QA review — scripts with sparse documentation receive WARNING findings.

Every code block should explain:
- WHAT you're trying to accomplish (the goal) → IAT Type 2: Intent Comment
- WHY you chose this approach (the reasoning) → IAT Type 3: Reasoning Comment
- WHAT assumptions you're making (the dependencies) → IAT Type 4: Assumption Comment

For tests and validations, explain:
- What behavior you're checking
- What would indicate success vs. failure
- Why this check matters

### Principle 5: Focus on Research Questions

**Balance rigor with usefulness.**

Always consider:
- What question are we actually answering?
- What level of rigor does this decision require?
- Are there multiple valid approaches with different tradeoffs?
- Should I check with the user before proceeding?

CHECK IN with users when:
- Multiple valid methodologies exist
- Tradeoffs between precision and practicality arise
- Findings are surprising or counterintuitive
- Scope might need adjustment

## Language Routing

This skill routes to **language-specific library skills** based on the execution
language set in CLAUDE.md § User Preferences and propagated in the agent's prompt.
When no language is specified, default to Python.

| Method | Python Skill | R Skill |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Data manipulation | `polars` | `tidyverse` |
| Static visualization | `plotnine` | `ggplot2` |
| Interactive visualization | `plotly` | `plotly-r` |
| Fixed effects / DiD | `pyfixest` | `fixest` |
| OLS / GLM / time series | `statsmodels` | `r-stats` |
| Panel / RE / IV / system | `linearmodels` | `plm` |
| Complex survey statistics | `svy` | `survey-r` |
| ML / clustering / PCA | `scikit-learn` | `tidymodels` |
| Geospatial | `geopandas` | `sf-terra` |
| Network analysis | `igraph` | `igraph-r` |
| Table formatting | `great-tables` | `gt` |
| Notebook | `marimo` | `quarto` |

All decision trees below use Python skill names as the primary label, with the R
counterpart noted inline as `(Python)`/`(R)` pairs. When the execution language is
R, substitute the R skill from this table. Time-series estimation routes to
`statsmodels` in Python and `r-stats` in R (see its `references/time-series.md`).

## Related Skills - When to Load

**Core Workflow Skills (Load Together):**
- `polars` (R: `tidyverse`) - Required for DataFrame operations; data-scientist provides methodology, polars/tidyverse provides syntax
- `marimo` (R: `quarto`) - Required for creating validated notebooks; data-scientist defines validation patterns, marimo/quarto provides implementation

**For Data Analysis Workflows:**

In the research pipeline, data-scientist methodology is applied within the **file-first execution pattern**:
- Write script files FIRST (to `scripts/stage{N}_{type}/`) as `.py` (Python) or `.R` (R)
- Execute via Bash with automatic output capture wrapper script
- Validation results get automatically embedded in scripts as comments
- Marimo (Python) or Quarto (R) notebook assembles validated scripts for interactive review

Closely read `agent_reference/SCRIPT_EXECUTION_REFERENCE.md` for the mandatory file-first execution protocol covering complete code file writing, output capture, and file versioning rules.

**The THEN-load steps apply to advisory and brainstorming turns as much as implementation.** Recommending a method, reviewing a plan, or talking through an approach that names a tool needs the routed library skill loaded just as much as writing code does. The library skills encode environment-specific constraints (which estimators and export backends are actually installed and working here) and curated caveats that general knowledge lacks or gets wrong — for example, when a familiar tool is statistically inappropriate for the data at hand. Naming a tool in advice without loading its skill risks recommending an approach this environment cannot run, or one the skill's curated caveats explicitly warn against. The norm extends one hop further: once the routed library skill is loaded, its own reference-file routing carries the same advisory-inclusive expectation — answer from its routed reference files, not just its SKILL.md overview.

**Visualization loading order matters:** The reference files provide *design principles* (what chart to use, how to direct attention, how to handle color accessibly). The tool skills provide *syntax* (how to code it). Read the design guidance first so implementation choices are principled, not ad-hoc.

**For Domain-Specific Analysis (e.g., CCD Education Data):**
- Load relevant `*-data-source-*` skill first to understand domain-specific data caveats
- Then apply data-scientist methodology with that context

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**
This skill assumes familiarity with:
- Python or R programming basics
- DataFrame concepts (rows, columns, filtering)
- Basic statistical concepts (mean, distribution, correlation)

**Important:** This skill provides the METHODOLOGY. The specialized skills provide TOOL KNOWLEDGE. Use both together — on advisory and brainstorming turns as much as when writing code. A methodology answer that names a tool without its skill loaded rests on general knowledge, which misses the environment constraints and curated caveats the tool skills encode.

### Validation Tracking

For multi-step transformations, track validation state with a simple dict (Python) or named list (R):

**Python:**
```python
validation_log = {}

# After each transformation step:
validation_log["Filter to high schools"] = {
    "pre_rows": pre_rows,
    "post_rows": result.shape[0],
    "status": "PASSED" if result.shape[0] > 0 else "FAILED",
}

# Print summary at end:
for step, info in validation_log.items():
    print(f"  [{info['status']}] {step}: {info['pre_rows']:,} → {info['post_rows']:,}")
```

**R:**
```r
validation_log <- list()

# After each transformation step:
validation_log[["Filter to high schools"]] <- list(
  pre_rows = pre_rows,
  post_rows = nrow(result),
  status = if (nrow(result) > 0) "PASSED" else "FAILED"
)

# Print summary at end:
for (step in names(validation_log)) {
  info <- validation_log[[step]]
  cat(sprintf("  [%s] %s: %s -> %s\n", info$status, step,
              format(info$pre_rows, big.mark = ","),
              format(info$post_rows, big.mark = ",")))
}
```

This is inline code, not a separate module. Never create a `validation.py` / `validation.R` or import a validation class.

### "I'm working with geographic/spatial data"

### "I need to analyze relationships or network structure"

```
Is a network frame appropriate for this question?
├─ Question is about attributes of individual units (how much, how many, what predicts Y)
│   └─ A network frame is NOT needed — use descriptive/regression/ML routing above.
│       Relational data can often be analyzed as ordinary tabular features.
├─ Question is about relationships, connectivity, or position within a web of ties
│   (who is central, who bridges groups, what clusters exist, how far apart are units)
│   └─ A network frame fits → ./references/network-analysis.md, then load
│       `igraph` skill (Python) or `igraph-r` skill (R)
│
├─ Which centrality answers my research question?
│   ├─ Activity / volume of direct ties → degree centrality
│   ├─ Brokerage / bridging between groups → betweenness
│   │   (NOTE: betweenness is NOT a resilience/robustness metric — do not read it that way)
│   ├─ Reach / average closeness to all others → closeness
│   │   (requires a connected component — see disconnected-graph guardrail below)
│   └─ Influence via being connected to well-connected units → eigenvector / PageRank
│       → ./references/network-analysis.md "Centrality Selection"
│
├─ I want to find groups / communities
│   └─ Community detection → prefer Leiden over Louvain (Louvain can yield
│       disconnected communities); ALWAYS set a seed (results are non-deterministic)
│       and record it; in R, cluster_leiden/cluster_louvain require an UNDIRECTED graph
│       → ./references/network-analysis.md "Community Detection"
│
├─ My data is two-mode / bipartite (e.g., people × events, authors × papers)
│   └─ Construct a bipartite graph, then project to one mode if needed — but
│       projection loses information and inflates ties; interpret projected
│       edges with care → ./references/network-analysis.md "Bipartite / Two-Mode Data"
│
├─ Before computing closeness/betweenness or trusting distances
│   ├─ Check connectivity/components first (these measures are ill-defined across
│   │   disconnected components) → network-analysis.md "Disconnected-Graph Guardrail"
│   └─ Confirm whether edge weights mean distance or strength — igraph treats a
│       `weight` attribute as DISTANCE and uses it automatically; pass weights=NA
│       to suppress → network-analysis.md "Weights-as-Distances Trap"
│
└─ I need statistical inference / generative network models (ERGM, SAOM, TERGM)
    └─ NOT currently covered by DAAF skills → escalate to orchestrator
        (noted as a future extension in network-analysis.md)
```

### "I need to predict an outcome or classify observations"

```
Am I predicting or explaining?
├─ Explaining (estimating a causal or associational parameter)
│   └─ Use pyfixest/statsmodels (Python) or fixest/r-stats (R) — see statistical-modeling.md
├─ Predicting (minimizing prediction error on new data)
│   ├─ Read supervised-ml.md for methodology
│   ├─ Load `scikit-learn` skill (Python) or `tidymodels` skill (R)
│   ├─ Tabular data → Start with logistic regression baseline,
│   │   then try HistGradientBoosting/LightGBM (Python) or ranger/xgboost (R)
│   ├─ Text data → See supervised-ml.md "When Deep Learning Methods Are Appropriate"
│   ├─ Need to explain predictions → scikit-learn/tidymodels interpretation refs (SHAP)
│   └─ Need fairness assessment → scikit-learn/tidymodels fairness refs
└─ Not sure → Read supervised-ml.md "Prediction vs. Inference"
```

## Essential Workflows

### New Data Workflow

When you receive new data, ALWAYS follow this sequence:

1. **Load and inspect** (do not transform yet)

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # Load data
   df = pl.read_csv("data.csv")  # or scan_csv for lazy
   
   # Immediate inspection
   print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
   print(f"Columns: {df.columns}")
   print(f"Types:\n{df.dtypes}")
   print(f"First 5 rows:\n{df.head()}")
   print(f"Last 5 rows:\n{df.tail()}")
   print(f"Random sample:\n{df.sample(5)}")
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # Load data
   library(tidyverse)
   library(arrow)
   df <- read_csv("data.csv")  # or read_parquet() for parquet
   
   # Immediate inspection
   cat("Shape:", nrow(df), "x", ncol(df), "\n")
   cat("Columns:", paste(names(df), collapse = ", "), "\n")
   glimpse(df)
   cat("First 5 rows:\n")
   print(head(df, 5))
   cat("Last 5 rows:\n")
   print(tail(df, 5))
   cat("Random sample:\n")
   print(df[sample(nrow(df), 5), ])
   ```

2. **Check data quality**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # Missing values
   print(f"Null counts:\n{df.null_count()}")
   print(f"Null percentages:\n{df.null_count() / len(df) * 100}")
   
   # Duplicates
   print(f"Duplicate rows: {len(df) - len(df.unique())}")
   
   # Unique values per column
   for col in df.columns:
       print(f"{col}: {df[col].n_unique()} unique values")
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # Missing values
   cat("Null counts:\n")
   print(colSums(is.na(df)))
   cat("Null percentages:\n")
   print(round(colSums(is.na(df)) / nrow(df) * 100, 2))
   
   # Duplicates
   cat("Duplicate rows:", nrow(df) - nrow(distinct(df)), "\n")
   
   # Unique values per column
   for (col in names(df)) {
     cat(col, ":", n_distinct(df[[col]]), "unique values\n")
   }
   ```

3. **Understand distributions**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # Numerical columns
   print(df.describe())
   
   # Categorical columns - value counts
   for col in df.select(pl.col(pl.String)).columns:
       print(f"\n{col}:\n{df[col].value_counts().head(10)}")
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # Numerical columns
   summary(df |> select(where(is.numeric)))
   
   # Categorical columns - value counts
   df |>
     select(where(is.character)) |>
     names() |>
     purrr::walk(\(col) {
       cat("\n", col, ":\n", sep = "")
       print(head(count(df, .data[[col]], sort = TRUE), 10))
     })
   ```

4. **Identify granularity**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # What uniquely identifies a row?
   # Test candidate keys
   candidate_keys = ["id", "user_id", ["user_id", "date"]]
   for key in candidate_keys:
       cols = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
       unique_count = df.select(cols).n_unique()
       print(f"{cols}: {unique_count} unique vs {len(df)} rows")
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # What uniquely identifies a row?
   # Test candidate keys
   candidate_keys <- list("id", "user_id", c("user_id", "date"))
   for (key in candidate_keys) {
     unique_count <- nrow(distinct(df, across(all_of(key))))
     cat(paste(key, collapse = ", "), ":", unique_count, "unique vs", nrow(df), "rows\n")
   }
   ```

5. **Document findings** before proceeding

### Transformation Workflow

For ANY data transformation:

1. **Document pre-state**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # Record state before transformation
   pre_shape = df.shape
   pre_columns = df.columns.copy()
   pre_sample = df.sample(10, seed=42)  # Reproducible sample
   pre_sum = df.select(pl.col("amount").sum()).item()  # If applicable
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # Record state before transformation
   pre_shape <- c(nrow(df), ncol(df))
   pre_columns <- names(df)
   set.seed(42)
   pre_sample <- df[sample(nrow(df), 10), ]  # Reproducible sample
   pre_sum <- sum(df$amount, na.rm = TRUE)  # If applicable
   ```

2. **Perform transformation with comments**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # GOAL: Filter to active users and calculate total spend
   # REASONING: We only want users who logged in within 30 days
   # EXPECTED: Fewer rows, same columns, preserved sum for included rows
   result = (
       df
       .filter(pl.col("last_login") > cutoff_date)  # Remove inactive
       .group_by("user_id")
       .agg(pl.col("amount").sum().alias("total_spend"))
   )
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # GOAL: Filter to active users and calculate total spend
   # REASONING: We only want users who logged in within 30 days
   # EXPECTED: Fewer rows, same columns, preserved sum for included rows
   result <- df |>
     dplyr::filter(last_login > cutoff_date) |>  # Remove inactive
     summarise(total_spend = sum(amount, na.rm = TRUE), .by = user_id)
   ```

3. **Validate post-state**

   **Python:**
   ```python
   # Verify transformation results
   post_shape = result.shape
   print(f"Shape: {pre_shape} -> {post_shape}")
   
   # Check sample of results
   sample_ids = pre_sample["user_id"].to_list()[:3]
   print(f"Sample before:\n{pre_sample.filter(pl.col('user_id').is_in(sample_ids))}")
   print(f"Sample after:\n{result.filter(pl.col('user_id').is_in(sample_ids))}")
   
   # Validate invariants where applicable
   # (e.g., sum should be preserved or explainably different)
   ```

   **R:**
   ```r
   # Verify transformation results
   post_shape <- c(nrow(result), ncol(result))
   cat("Shape:", paste(pre_shape, collapse = "x"), "->", paste(post_shape, collapse = "x"), "\n")
   
   # Check sample of results
   sample_ids <- pre_sample$user_id[1:3]
   cat("Sample before:\n")
   print(pre_sample |> dplyr::filter(user_id %in% sample_ids))
   cat("Sample after:\n")
   print(result |> dplyr::filter(user_id %in% sample_ids))
   
   # Validate invariants where applicable
   # (e.g., sum should be preserved or explainably different)
   ```

4. **Document what you verified**

### Analysis Workflow

From question to answer:

1. **Clarify the question**
   - What decision will this inform?
   - What would a "good" answer look like?
   - What level of rigor is required?

2. **Assess data fitness**
   - Does the data contain what we need?
   - What are the limitations?
   - Are there gaps or quality issues?

3. **Choose methodology**
   - What approaches are valid?
   - What are the tradeoffs?
   - CHECK WITH USER if multiple valid options

4. **Execute with verification**
   - Follow transformation workflow
   - Document each step thoroughly

5. **Validate findings**
   - Do results make sense?
   - Cross-check with known facts
   - Identify limitations and caveats

6. **Communicate with appropriate uncertainty**

## Marimo Integration

When working in marimo notebooks:

### Cell Organization Pattern

```python
# Cell 1: Imports and setup
import marimo as mo
import polars as pl

# Cell 2: Data loading (separate cell for reactivity)
df = pl.read_csv("data.csv")

# Cell 3: Data inspection (markdown + code)
mo.md("## Data Inspection")
# ... inspection code ...

# Cell 4: Data quality checks
mo.md("## Data Quality")
# ... quality checks ...

# Cell 5+: Analysis cells, each with:
# - Markdown explaining goal
# - Code with thorough comments
# - Validation of results
```

### Using Reactivity for Validation

```python
# Create interactive validators
validation_column = mo.ui.dropdown(
    options=df.columns,
    label="Select column to validate"
)

# Reactive validation display
mo.md(f"""
### Validation for `{validation_column.value}`
- Null count: {df[validation_column.value].null_count()}
- Unique values: {df[validation_column.value].n_unique()}
- Sample values: {df[validation_column.value].head(5).to_list()}
""")
```

### Documentation Cells

Use markdown cells liberally:
- Before code: explain what you're about to do and why
- After code: summarize findings and implications
- At decision points: document choices made

## Quarto Integration

When working in Quarto notebooks (R pipelines):

### Chunk Organization Pattern

```r
# Chunk 1: Library loading
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)

# Chunk 2: Data loading (separate chunk)
df <- read_parquet("data.parquet")

# Chunk 3: Data inspection (with narrative)
#| echo: true
# ... inspection code ...

# Chunk 4: Data quality checks
# ... quality checks ...

# Chunk 5+: Analysis chunks, each with:
# - Narrative text explaining goal
# - Code with thorough IAT comments
# - Validation of results
```

### Inline Validation

```r
# Validate inline — no separate validation files
stopifnot(nrow(df) > 0)
cat("Shape:", nrow(df), "x", ncol(df), "\n")
cat("Columns:", paste(names(df), collapse = ", "), "\n")
```

### Documentation Chunks

Use narrative text chunks liberally:
- Before code: explain what you are about to do and why
- After code: summarize findings and implications
- At decision points: document choices made

## Citation Responsibility

When analytical methods from this skill's reference materials are used in DAAF analyses,
the research-executor includes relevant citations in its structured output. Focus on
**primary citations** — the papers and tools that directly enable the analytical results,
not every background reference mentioned in the reference files.

Each citation must include a brief rationale explaining why it is included, so the
researcher can make informed decisions about what to keep in the final report.

For the master citation index and inclusion thresholds, consult
`agent_reference/CITATION_REFERENCE.md`.
